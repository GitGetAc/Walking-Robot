This web application is a simple simulation where the player can navigate a robot through a dungeon-like environment using keyboard controls.

### Mechanics
- Players can control the robot by pressing the arrow keys, which changes the robot's direction and triggers corresponding animations.
- The game features a simple collision detection system that wraps the robot around the edges of the canvas, simulating a dungeon environment.
- Additional visual elements, such as a bridge overhang, are drawn onto the canvas to enhance the dungeon theme.
- The game also logs pressed keys to the console, providing feedback on the current state of controls.
